# Analyzing London's Santander Cycle Hire Scheme to Investigate Usage Patterns and Public Transport Accessibility

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the Londonâ€™s Santander Bicycle Sharing Scheme data since 2011. Our main objectives include -
- Investigate the geographic distribution and temporal trends of bicycle usage across different zones in London.
- Examine the variation in bicycle usage patterns among different demographics and user types (e.g., casual users vs. registered members).
- Analyze variation in trends of bike rentals based on days of the week and seasonal variations.
